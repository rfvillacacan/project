Task Updates modals now support scrolling lists of comments and allow each author to delete their own comments. Notifications for new comments are checked periodically for both managers and team members and new comments are fetched in real time while update modals remain open.

Use `php -d variables_order=EGPCS vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the test suite and `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run` for the codingâ€‘style check. Ensure PHP and the required dependencies are available before running these commands.
