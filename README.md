Task Updates modals now support scrolling lists of comments and allow each author to delete their own comments. Notifications for new comments are checked periodically for both managers and team members and new comments are fetched in real time while update modals remain open. Run `php -d variables_order=EGPCS vendor/bin/phpunit` for tests and `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run` for style checks.
